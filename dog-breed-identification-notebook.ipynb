    "## 4.Features\n",
    "Some information about the data:\n",
    "* we are dealing with images(unstructured data), so it is probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning\n",
    "* There are 120 breeds of dogs (This means there are 120 different classes).\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set(These images have labels)\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set(These images have no labels), because we will want to predict them.\n",
